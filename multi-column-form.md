#Weekend Homework Questions

##What does it do?
###-What interactive elements exist?
The site consists of 3 columns of interactive elements. mostly they seem to be text boxes, but theres one dropdown menu in each column. there's also a submit button at the bottom.
###-How do you interact with them?
The text boxes are typed into. It seems that you'll give it mostly strings. The drop downs you click on and choose an option among those listed.
###-What visual effects are produced by interacting?
The dropdown menus are the most dramatic. When clicked on they pop up a list of options. This list covers surrounding elements waiting for you to select one. to a lesser degree the textboxes change color when focused and the text in them changes from the placeholder color to white.
##What does it do?
###-What existing HTML elements are changed?
It seems like they're styling the textboxes and drowpdowns to make them look different but they're not really.... CHANGNIG the html. thats probably mostly done in CSS. But by using CSS, the author has changed pretty much all the elements on the page. the dropdowns and textboxes, the submit button, <body> etc.
###-What new HTML elements are created?
I don't understand this question. The author of the page is using standard HTML elements and tags and styling them in a different way to make them LOOK new and interesting. He's not creating new HTML tag definitions and using them in the code. or if he is, it isn't immediately apparent.
###-What CSS styles are used to produce the effect?
I think that you can style form elements just as easily as you can style text using the same styles, (which is convienent). So I assume the author has used styles like color, position, background, border etc. He's also using media queries to help change the layout based on size. this looks complicated but I Think I can handle it.
